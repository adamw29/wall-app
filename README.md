App Wall allows users to share their items (food, drinks) they want to sell
at the parties. Food has its name, description and weight. Drink has its
name and volume. Both drink and food have price and quantity.

As an anonymous user you can:

As an authenticated user you can:
- see one list of items of both types: food and drinks for all users
- create a new item (both types)
- see and remove only your item
